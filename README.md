# PileShuffleOptimization

Find optimal number of piles for pile shuffling to maximize probability of x lands per pile

Uses Hypergeometric distribution h(x; p, n, k) = [kCx][p-kCn-x]/[pCn]

p: number of items in population

k: Number of items in population that are successes

n: Number of items in sample(size of piles)

x: Number of items in sample(pile) that are success
